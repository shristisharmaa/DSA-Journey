## 🌱 Why I Made This

I wanted **organized, easy-to-understand** DSA notes that I can *quickly revise anytime*.  

Instead of messy or copied notes, I'm writing them **my own way** on Notion—so they make sense to **me** (and hopefully help others too).

## 🤝 Usage and Contributions

- Feel free to **read** and **refer** to these notes if they help you!
